\section{Introduction}
The introduction should directly lead to the main topic of the paper. It
should not be a historical essay or a deep reaching explanation of
the topic, but it should explain concisely what the main questions
of the topic are, why they are interesting, and which methods or
data will be used. A further goal of the introduction is to define the
structure for the paper. This can be achieved by describing
the goals, the methods and the main results of the paper.
Methods and results do not have to be
discussed in detail - this is left to the main part of the paper -
 but they should be summed up in a short way.
 The introduction of a paper is often finished by a short ``roadmap''.
 This is not necessary, if the aspects mentioned above have been
 laid out in a satisfactory way before. \citep{hastieElementsStatisticalLearning2017} This is a reference test from the new .tex file \ref{fig:average2}

\include{chapters/01introduction}


\section{Main part}
\subsection{Literature overview and citation}
The literature overview may be kept short in a bachelor thesis. Bachelor theses
 whose main purpose is to present and discuss the contents
of published articles are exceptions. When referring to articles or
other literature, it is essential to mark these as references. This is best


\begin{equation}\label{eq:xsquared}
  f(x) = x^2\\
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:integral}
  F(x) = \int^a_b \frac{1}{3}x^3
\end{equation}

done in the text itself. When referring to papers, the author
and the year of publication should be given, e.g. ``Imbens
(2002) gives an overview for the GMM-estimator and its empirical
likelihood''. See for example in \eqref{eq:xsquared} for the squared one
and \eqref{eq:integral} for an example of a fancy integral.


If the paper was written by more than two authors, this fact
is usually abbreviated as, for example, ``Imbens et al. (2002)''.
If there was more than one publication in the same year, a small letter should be added to
the year such as ``Imbens (1997a)''. When referring to a whole
chapter, the chapter should be mentioned, e.g. ``Wooldridge (2002),
ch. 13''.

Direct citations must be enclosed in quotation marks. In
this case the year of publication should be added with the author's
name, e.g. ``Generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation has
become an important unifying framework for inference in econometrics
in the last 20 years (Imbens (2002), p. 493)''. The use of direct
citations should be kept to a minimum.

\subsection{Theory and methods}
When writing an empirical bachelor thesis, the theoretical part should be
limited to an amount necessary to understand the empirical part. It
is better to limit the theory to the special cases rather
than striving for a maximum of generality. Of course,
when writing a theoretical paper, or a paper on pure methods,
the theoretical part will receive more weight. However,
the presentation should always be structured so that it clearly
works out the main points, concentrating on the aspects
that are really central to the topic. Detailed proofs should be moved
to the appendix.


\subsection{Data}

When writing an empirical paper, it is necessary to give a
concise description of the data set that is being used. This description
should include information about the data set provider and
the variables used. A descriptive analysis of the data is useful, but it may also be
moved to the appendix.

\subsection{Empirical Analysis}

In the empirical section, the main results should be
explained first. If this is not possible, because intermediate steps
are required to understand the results, then only
intermediate results should be explained that are really essential
for this purpose.  Tables and figures should be used to present
the main results. In addition, the tables and figures have to be
discussed in the text. Each table and each figure must have
their own title and caption.

It is often useful to investigate the robustness of the results
with respect to different aspects. If the results were calculated under
the homoskedasticity assumption for example, one should discuss what
happens if the assumption is violated. More detailed empirical results
should be put into the appendix unless there are important reasons not to do
so.

\section{Conclusion}

The conclusion should contain a summary of the main results and its implications. One can
also mention directions for future research.

\section{R Code}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=R,caption={Fibonacci Secquence}, label=lst:testcode]
fib <- function(n) {
  if (n < 2)
    n
  else
    fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
}
fib(10)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{verbatim}
  fib <- function(n) {
  if (n < 2)
    n
  else
    fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
}
fib(10)
\end{verbatim}

See Test Code \ref{lst:testcode} for the code example.

\section{Formatting rules}

\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item Letter size 11 to 12pt, line spacing 1 - 1.5 times letter size, margins left/right 2.5cm, bottom 3cm, top 2.5cm.
\item Pre-introduction page numbers should be roman, the ones of the main text arabic.
\item The table of contents shows chapters and sections.
\item The list of figures and tables list all the figures and tables in the paper.
\item Every figure and table should have a short title plus description and should be explained in the text.
\item The number of pages of the main text should be between 10-15 pages (appendix excluded).
\end{itemize}
\end{center}
