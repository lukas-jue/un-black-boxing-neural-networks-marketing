  volume = {11},
  issn = {0883-9026},
  abstract = {Previous studies of venture capital investment criteria, which have tended to utilize traditional Likert-scaled survey methods, have produced some general findings which indicate that the ``human factor'' is of utmost importance. However, virtually all of these studies have been undertaken with U.S.-based venture capitalists. In addition, the studies have generally been exploratory and have assumed a single hierarchy of decision criteria in all cases and across all venture capitalists. We do not accept that this is valid; therefore, our study tested this assumption by investigating the trade-offs made by venture capitalists in Europe. Thirty-five investment criteria were identified from the literature and from experts in the field, and a questionnaire was developed that required the venture capitalist to make 53 pairwise trade-offs with multiple levels. Seventy-three venture capitalists from across Europe were interviewed and completed the questionnaire. Conjoint analysis was used to compute relative rankings, and overall rankings were computed to provide some general insight into the overall importance of the various criteria. After this, cluster analysis was used to identify different decision groupings. The trade-offs were randomized in the questionnaire but, for descriptive purposes, fall into the following groupings: financial, product-market, strategic-competitive, fund, management team, management competence, and deal. All five management team criteria (as opposed to management competence criteria) were ranked among the first seven, product-market criteria appeared to be only moderately important, and fund and deal criteria were at the bottom of the rankings. Overall, we conclude that the venture capitalists interviewed would, as a group, prefer to select an opportunity that offers a good management team and reasonable financial and product-market characteristics, even if the opportunity does not meet the overall fund and deal requirements. It appears, quite logically, that without the correct management team and a reasonable idea, good financials are generally meaningless because they will never be achieved. Cluster analysis identified three groupings of venture capitalists: those primarily concerned with investing nationally, those who focus solely upon the deal, and those mainstream investors who consistently and instinctively rank the five management team criteria at the top of their list. However, there was no evident country bias\textemdash{}a conclusion that is sustained if the countries are grouped by physical proximity (northern versus southern Europe) or by size of the local venture capital community, a surrogate for experience. Moreover, there was no relationship to the scale of the fund, the typical round of financing, or the apparent network. The article concludes by outlining the implications of the study for venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and the research community.},

  title = {A Lack of Insight: Do Venture Capitalists Really Understand Their Own Decision Process?},
  volume = {13},
  issn = {0883-9026},
  shorttitle = {A Lack of Insight},
  abstract = {What decision criteria do venture capitalists (VCs) use to make their investment decisions? This question has received much attention within entrepreneurship literature (i.e.,Wells 1974; Poindexter 1976; Tyebjee and Bruno 1984; MacMillan, Seigel, and Subba Narasimha 1985; MacMillan, Zeman, and Subba Narasimha 1987; Robinson 1987; Timmons et al. 1987; Sandberg, Schweiger, and Hofer 1988; Hall and Hofer 1993; Zacharakis and Meyer 1995) for a number of reasons. First, VC-backed ventures achieve a higher survival rate than non-VC-backed businesses (Kunkel and Hofer 1990; Sandberg 1986; Timmons 1994). Second, a better understanding of the decision process may lead to even better survival rates. Finally, entrepreneurs seeking venture funding benefit if they understand what factors are most important to the VC.
Although past research has greatly contributed to our understanding of the decision, it may be biased and somewhat misleading. The majority of past studies rely on post hoc methodologies (e.g., interviews and surveys) to capture the decision process. Post hoc methods assume that VCs can accurately relate their own decision processes, but studies from cognitive psychology suggest that people, in particular experts, are poor at introspecting. Introspection is subject to rationalization and post hoc recall biases. Using social judgment theory and the associated lens model as a framework, the current study investigates how well VCs introspect about their own decision process and, by extension, whether the past research efforts are biased.
The current research uses policy capturing, a real-time method common in cognitive psychology, to capture the VC's ``actual theories in use'' versus their ``espoused theories'' (Hitt and Tyler 1991). Policy capturing requires that VCs make a series of real-time decisions based on various information factors. Regression analysis of each VCs' decision captures how important each of the information factors is to her/his actual decision process. After the VCs make their decisions, they provided a weighting of how they believe they used the information factors. Comparing the captured decision policies to stated decision policies provides a measure of VC insight.
The findings suggest that VCs are not good at introspecting about their own decision process. Even within the confines of a controlled experiment, which greatly reduces the amount of information considered, VCs lacked strong understanding of how they made decisions. Most decision-makers would like to have all relevant information available for their decision. However, as more information becomes available, insight diminishes. Finally, this study finds that VCs are very consistent in their decision process, even though they do not necessarily understand how they make their decisions.
VCs face a plethora of information when making an investment decision (i.e., business plan, outside consultants, due diligence, etc.). It may be difficult for VCs to truly understand their intuitive decision process because of all the noise caused by this information overload. This lack of systematic understanding impedes learning. VCs cannot make accurate adjustments to their evaluation process if they do not truly understand it. Therefore, VCs may suffer from a systematic bias that impedes the performance of their investment portfolio. The methodology used in this experiment can be modified and used as a training tool for active VCs. In addition, the consistent nature of VC decision-making (even if they do not have a strong understanding of that process) is favorable to the development of decision aides. Decision aides can minimize the danger of salient information (e.g., the lead entrepreneur is a winner) clouding the VC's judgment.
Past research also needs to be interpreted in a new light. Although VCs undoubtedly use some of the information cited in past studies, the relative importance of that information needs to be reevaluated. VCs may not, for instance, rely most on the background of the entrepreneurial team. In addition, it is likely that the past studies provide more information factors than VCs actually use. People have a tendency to overstate the information they believe they relied upon and to use far less information (typically three to seven factors) to make a decision than they actually think they use. The methodology used in this experiment has the potential to identify the more relevant information factors cited in previous work.
Even though VCs are experts in the new venture funding realm, their decision process has room for improvement. Almost 40\% of all backed ventures fail to provide a return to the VC. Considering the billions invested each year, a modest improvement in the failure rate can have a substantial impact on venture portfolio returns. That improvement starts by better understanding the decision process. This study is a step in that direction.},

  issn = {0929-1199},
  shorttitle = {The Determinants of Venture Capital Funding},
  abstract = {This paper analyses the determinants of venture capital for a sample of 21 countries. In particular, we consider the importance of initial public offerings (IPOs), gross domestic product (GDP) and market capitalization growth, labor market rigidities, accounting standards, private pension funds, and government programs. We find that IPOs are the strongest driver of venture capital investing. Private pension fund levels are a significant determinant over time but not across countries. Surprisingly, GDP and market capitalization growth are not significant. Government policies can have a strong impact, both by setting the regulatory stage, and by galvanizing investment during downturns. Finally, we also show that different types of venture capital financing are affected differently by these factors. In particular, early stage venture capital investing is negatively impacted by labor market rigidities, while later stage is not. IPOs have no effect on early stage venture capital investing across countries, but are a significant determinant of later stage venture capital investing across countries. Finally, government funded venture capital has different sensitivities to the determinants of venture capital than non-government funded venture capital. Our insights emphasize the need for a more differentiated approach to venture capital, both from a research as well as from a policy perspective. We feel that while later stage venture capital investing is well understood, early stage and government funded investments still require more extensive research.},

  title = {Criteria Distinguishing Successful from Unsuccessful Ventures in the Venture Screening Process},
  volume = {2},
  issn = {0883-9026},
  abstract = {Venture Capitalists responded to a questionnaire in which they rated a highly successful and a highly unsuccessful venture on 25 screening criteria and on several performance criteria. In all, 150 ventures were rated by 67 venture capital firms. Cluster analysis revealed three broad classes of unsuccessful ventures. The first type is the bane of all venture capitalists\textemdash{}the venture in which the venture team is lacking in experience or staying power, the product has no prototype, and there is no clear market demand for the product, yet the venture somehow slips through the screens and gets funded. The second type is one in which the venture team is very well credentialed, but the venture faces early competition and the team has no staying power and runs out of steam. The third major class of venture is one in which the team has exceptional staying power, so much so that by perserverance it demonstrates that a market exists, only to lose that market to competition because of a lack of protection for the product. Cluster analysis also showed that there are four broad classes of successful ventures. First is the high-tech venture with a well-qualified venture team that has the staying power needed to face competitive attack. Second is the class of venture where the venture team does not have much in the way of credentials, but the product has a very high level of protection and turns out to be highly successful. Third is a class of ``market makers''\textemdash{}a venture team with exceptional perseverance that demonstrates that there is in fact a market for the product, but also has some form of product protection once that market has been demonstrated. It can be seen that each of these classes of successes has a look-alike class of failures that is very similar except for some flaw in the venture team. A final class of successful venture is a small group of low-tech products in which distribution skills are critical. We suspect that these ventures tend to be for consumer goods. An important finding is the identification of two major criteria that are predictors of venture success. These are 1) the extent to which the venture is initially insulated from competition and 2) the degree to which there is demonstrated market acceptance of the product. Regression analyses indicate that only these two screening criteria correlate pervasively across several performance criteria. Interestingly, neither of these criteria were rated as essential in an earlier study. Much more importance needs to be attached to these criteria in screening venture proposals. The final analysis was a factor analysis, which indicates that the 150 ventures were screened according to five major classes of criteria, each class corresponding to some facet of risk management of the venture. These were as follows: 1.1. Criteria that screen out ventures where there is a risk of failure due to unqualified management;2.2. Criteria that screen out management that may well be qualified but lack experience;3.3. Criteria that screen out ventures where basic viability of the project is in doubt;4.4. Criteria that screen out ventures where there is high exposure to competitive attack and profit erosion before the investment can be recouped;5.5. Finally, criteria that avoid ventures that lock up the investment so that it cannot be cashed out for long periods of time.},

  title = {Assessing Venture Capital Investments with Noncompensatory Behavioral Decision Models},
  volume = {2},
  issn = {0883-9026},
  abstract = {This article examines the prospect of a decision support system for the assessment of venture capital investments. It approaches the task of developing decision models from the perspective of the venture capitalist. Thus venture capitalists have played an active role in defining the predictor variables and in providing data on their own investments. Venture capitalists (and recent research) underscore the importance of the entrepreneur in new ventures and the predictor variables selected reflect this bias. The literature is now replete with studies demonstrating the superiority of multiattribute actuarial models over human judgment for diverse decision environments, ranging from medical science to finance. This class of behavioral decision models consists of the simultaneous consideration of several attributes relevant to a decision. Actuarial models of this kind can be applied to attribute and decision data based on the decision maker's judgments (i.e., expected outcomes) before the events transpire\textemdash{}termed judgment-based models. They can also be applied to data on past events or actual outcomes where known\textemdash{}termed environment-based models. Again, it needs to be emphasized that actuarial models, whether based on the decision maker's judgments or on the environment, usually outperform the decision maker. These general principles are applied here. Among actuarial models a particular subclass of models is called noncompensatory. In these models, a low value for one attribute cannot be compensated by a high value for another attribute. As an example. in selecting a place-kicker in football, athletic skills other than kicking ability are irrelevant. In this study, two types of noncompensatory actuarial models, conjunctive and disjunctive, are used to model both venture capitalists' judgments and the environment. Interviews with venture capitalists reveal that some place strong emphasis on one or two attributes in judging a potential investment. This type of decision-making behavior indicates a disjunctive decision process. At the same time, there can be a tendency to ensure that a prospective investment is satisfactory at a minimum the entrepreneur's tenacity/courage is a redundant variable that is sublimated in desire for success and enthusiasm/capacity for work.},

  shorttitle = {Hybrid Conjoint Analysis},
  abstract = {How venture capitalists select start-ups for financing has been an interesting topic for many researchers and practitioners. The underlying assumption is that people who make money investing in new businesses by assessing the proposals should be experienced enough to distinguish losers from winners. Our research study tested three models (self-explicated, conjoint and a hybrid\textemdash{}comprising the two previous ones\textemdash{}conjoint) in order to find out: 1. if these models could be applied to venture capital decision making and if so 2. to demonstrate the potential of conjoint analysis as a practical research method. 3. To test whether or not the characteristics of the entrepreneur, the product and the market replicate the venture capital decision. This research study confirms what normative literature on decision-making emphasizes: that in the first stage of an evaluation (screening), venture capitalists focus on a small subset of criteria in a non-compensatory process (i.e., an unacceptable value on one criterion cannot be offset by a high value of another one). The important criteria in this phase appear to be the entrepreneur's experience and the existence of a prototype for some decision-makers or unique features of the product for others. The screening step is more judgemental than analytic. In a second stage (the evaluation phase), however, venture capitalists end a detailed examination (due diligence process) by choosing the most preferred ventures through processes approximating compensatory rules; that is, a low but acceptable value on one criterion can be compensated by a high value on another. The most important criteria identified by the research in this second stage are criteria found in the previous stage, product gross profit margin and patent. Our research demonstrates agreement among venture capitalists in terms of one criterion to evaluate research proposals: managerial experience. As to the rest of the attributes tested, there was variation in the weights assigned to them. The findings of this pilot study also confirm the applicability of conjoint analysis as a research method in venture capital decision. The approach helps shed light on the decision rules applied, and permits the testing of previously researched criteria for predictive validity. The method has the advantage of retaining individual preferences and clustering them around venture capitalists' demographic and psychographic backgrounds (i.e., years of experience, type of education, life-style, and the like) or other types of information such as venture fund policies (size of the investment, type of industry, etc.). The major implication of the study for entrepreneurs is the importance of previous experience in the industry where they expect to develop their ventures, and a deep knowledge of the product (advantages over competition, technical, production, and cost feasibility) they are to produce and market. These are the factors that have the greatest influence on venture capitalists' evaluation of such projects.},

Bilaterally isolated carotid chemoreceptors were perfused with autologous blood of varying O2 and CO2 tensions via an extracorporeal lung circuit. Systemic gas tensions were unchanged. Effects of carotid chemoreceptor stimulation on coronary vascular resistance, left ventricular dP/dt, and strain-gauge arch output were studied at natural coronary blood flow with the chest closed and during constant-flow perfusion of the left common coronary artery with the chest open. Carotid chemoreceptor stimulation slightly increased left ventricular dP/dt and slightly decreased the strain-gauge arch output, while markedly increasing systemic pressure. Coronary blood flow increased; however, coronary vascular resistance wa.as not affected. These studies show that local carotid body stimulation increases coronary blood flow but has little effect on the myocardium. The increase in coronary blood flow results mainly from an increase in systemic arterial pressure. Thus these data provide little evidence for increased sympathetic activity of the heart during local stimulation of the carotid chemoreceptors with hypoxic and hypercapnic blood.},

Objective estimates of cytopathology (quantifiable neutral red uptake and cell protein determination) showed that cell deterioration was a slow process in HVT-infected cells when compared to infection by herpes simplex virus. Experiments with irradiated host cells demonstrated that HVT required functional cell DNA for replication. The inactivation of the necessary host cell function displayed multihit kinetics. In agreement with data on other herpesviruses, HVT damaged by UV light could be photoreactivated in chick cells. The results indicate that HVT shares biologic properties in common with other herpes and transforming viruses.},

  shorttitle = {Ageing and Health-Care Expenditure},
  abstract = {Zweifel and colleagues have previously proposed that proximity to death is a more important influence on health-care costs than age, suggesting that demographic change per se will not have a large impact on future aggregate health expenditure. However, issues of econometric methodology have led to challenges of the robustness of these findings. This paper revisits the analysis. Using a longitudinal hospital data set from Oxfordshire, England, the two-step Heckman model from the Zweifel study is first replicated, to find that neither age nor proximity to death have a significant effect on hospital costs. Econometric problems with the model are demonstrated, and instead a two-part model shows both age and proximity to death to have significant effects on quarterly hospital costs. Cost predictions, calculated with bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals, further demonstrate that while age may significantly affect quarterly costs, these cost changes are small compared to the tripling of quarterly costs that occurs with approaching death in the last year of life. The analyses show the importance of model selection to properly assess the determinants of health-care expenditures. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Today, most major statistical programs perform, by default, unbalanced ANOVA based on Type III sums of squares (Yates's weighted squares of means). As criticized by Nelder and Lane (1995), this analysis is founded on unrealistic models\textemdash{}models with interactions, but without all corresponding main effects. The Type II analysis (Yates's method of fitting constants) is usually not preferred because of the underlying assumption of no interactions. This argument is, however, also founded on unrealistic models. Furthermore, by considering the power of the two methods, it is clear that Type II is preferable.},

The problem of breaking up the treatment means into distinguishable groups has not been discussed at much length, the solutions given in the various textbooks differ and, what is more important, seem solely based on intuition. After discussing the problem On a basis combining intuition with some hard, cold facts about the distributions of certain test quantities (or "statistics") a simple and definite procedure is proposed for dividing treatments into distinguishable groups, and for determining that the treatments within some of these groups are different, although there is not enough evidence to say "which is which." The procedure is illustrated on examples.},

If multiple null hypotheses are tested simultaneously, the probability of rejecting erroneously at least one of them increases beyond the pre-specified significance level. Simultaneous inference procedures have to be used which adjust for multiplicity and thus control the overall type I error rate. In this paper we describe simultaneous inference procedures in general parametric models, where the experimental questions are specified through a linear combination of elemental model parameters. The framework described here is quite general and extends the canonical theory of multiple comparison procedures in ANOVA models to linear regression problems, generalized linear models, linear mixed effects models, the Cox model, robust linear models, etc. Several examples using a variety of different statistical models illustrate the breadth of the results. For the analyses we use the R add-on package multcomp, which provides a convenient interface to the general approach adopted here.},

Using two nonnormal distributions (exponential and lognormal), it is found that the test is fairly insensitive for moderate and equal sample size (n = 32) when the variances are equal. Further, for small samples (n {$<$} 32), the test is conservative with respect to Type I error. It is also conservative with respect to Type II error for a large range of {$\varphi$} (noncentrality), depending on the size of the sample and {$\alpha$}. When the within cell error variances are heterogenous, the test continues to be conservative for the upper values of {$\varphi$} and slightly biased toward larger Type II errors for smaller values of {$\varphi$} depending on the size of {$\alpha$}. Analysis of the correlation between the numerator and denominator of F under the null hypothesis indicates that the robustness feature is largely due to this correlation. Analytic proofs under the non-null hypothesis were not possible, but some empirical results are presented.},

In judging governance structures and regulation, I argue that dynamic efficiency has been underemphasized in the debate over privatization and that airline deregulation has been most important in shifting the balance of power between airlines and airports.},

However there has been very little attempt to synthesise this research and identify overarching findings that single studies do not produce. Hence it is the aim here to apply a systematic review of all the results in the academic literature. Both the objectives and outcomes of privatisation are considered although the literature appears surprisingly lacking in assessing whether these are closely aligned. A need for improvements in efficiency, coupled with a requirement for greater investment, appear to be the key drivers of privatisation but the evidence, as to whether there are actually performance benefits, is inconclusive. Improvements need to be made to the methods used, but given that the range of airport privatisation models has now become so diverse, more focus on governance and institutional structures may also yield useful conclusions.},

Since there is basically no research on the resulting dilemma of capital funding requirements and delivering shareholder value, the aim of this paper is to explore this issue in depth. In order to address the question if privatized airports earn their cost of capital, 2003\textendash{}2009 data is used for a long-term trend analysis, comparing the financial performance of ten publicly quoted European airports. The majority of sample airports generate a negative economic value added for most of the seven years and correlational research reveals that traffic-induced investment spending is the single most influential factor. Airport management can improve the value-added margin between the return rate generated by the capital permanently employed and its weighted average cost via optimal phasing of investment activities, gearing of the balance sheet and financing of capital expenditure.},

  abstract = {It is often argued that market regulation should only be applied to airports with significant degrees of market power, to avoid regulatory costs to exceed respective benefits. However, the measurement of airport market power is not a trivial issue, not least given the wide range of different market segments airports operate in. The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology for the assessment of airport market power which can be applied to the European airports. First, we provide an overview of existing methodologies applied in empirical studies that try to assess the degrees of airport market power. It is found that, while the literature provides some very detailed assessments for specific airports, no comparative studies for a wider range of European airports, based on uniform and transparent criteria, has so far been undertaken. Therefore we develop a transparent modelling approach for the estimation of airport market power in the local passenger market segment, which requires detailed regional GDP data on NUTS 3 level, airport-region distances and flight supply on the airport level, as reported by the Official Airline Guide (OAG), as main input data. We show and discuss the results for the 50 largest European airports.},

  abstract = {The 2008 financial crisis has changed the structure of banking, generating public distrust in the conventional financial system. An alternative has emerged as a result of this lack of confidence. This alternative is known as ethical banking. A growing number of investors, asset managers, and financial intermediaries have incorporated sustainability considerations into their business practices. This paper discusses the origins of ethical banking and describes its primary characteristics. The goal is to determine whether ethical banking can be as profitable as conventional banking despite only investing in projects based on social values. A comparative analysis is performed to identify differences between an ethical bank (Triodos Bank) and a conventional bank (Banco Santander). The analysis was conducted to study the financial activity of both banks over a four-year period (2012\&ndash;2015). The balance sheets, profit and loss accounts, liquidity ratios, indebtedness, and returns provided by both banks were analyzed. The results indicate that ethical banking is less profitable than conventional banking. Nevertheless, customers are attracted to the social investments and financial transparency that characterize ethical banking. Over the study period, Triodos Bank experienced a greater increase in the number of employees and the volume of loans and deposits than did Banco Santander. Triodos Bank invests in social and environmental projects. This investment approach makes it less profitable than Banco Santander.},

  abstract = {Aristotle, who, having predated Adam Smith by 2000 years, deserves to be recognized as the world's first economist (), distinguished between two different senses of what we call economics: oikonomikos, or household trading, which he approved of and considered essential to the working of any even slightly complex society, and chrematisike, or trade for profit, which he considered selfish and utterly devoid of virtue, calling those who engaged in such practices ``parasites''. Of course, consumers do not purchase and invest for solely economic reasons (). Interest in ethics in economics has been the subject of continuous study. In this regard, the recent financial crisis has had not only economic, but also social, psychological, political, and ethical consequences, which have impacted the financial and banking system. Consumers are no longer drawn only by the economic return but also by ethical factors. Ethical banking is on the rise. This paper aims to explain the reasons for the growth in ethical banking and to answer the following questions: can banking consumers-investors change the characterization of the banking system? Can ethical banking gain ground on traditional banking? And is ethical banking really effective? To this end, it will examine the Spanish case, using econometric causal regression models to identify the reasons why consumers decide to invest in ethical banking and determine its role in the Spanish economy.},

In this article, we explore whether any discrepancy exists between the communicated (based on information disclosed in the annual reports) and ideal (disclosure of information deemed vital based on the Islamic ethical business framework) ethical identities and we measure this by what we have termed the Ethical Identity Index (EII). Our longitudinal survey results over a 3-year period indicate the overall mean EII of only one IB out of seven surveyed to be above average. The remaining six IBs suffer from disparity between the communicated and ideal ethical identities. We further found the largest incongruence to be related to four dimensions: commitments to society; disclosure of corporate vision and mission; contribution to and management of zakah, charity and benevolent loans; and information regarding top management. The results have important implications for communication management if IBs are to enhance their image and reputation in society as well as to remain competitive.},

  abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},
